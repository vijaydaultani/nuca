## NUCA

This presentation refers to my work I done during my Minor Project during my masters under Prof. M. Balakrishnan and Ass. Prof. S.R. Sarangi.

### Table of Contents
Goal of this project was to perform analysis of energy breakdown of Static and Dynamic Non-Uniform Cache Access (NUCA). Also to measure power consumption and collect heat generation patters of NUCA architecture. Additionally to interpret inter banks link data access patterns.

- Goal
- Cache Architecture
	- UCA and NUCA Architecture
- Energy Breakdown of NUCA
- Test Program and Cache Bank Placement 
- Experiment 1
	- Expose the effect of two different cache mapping policies of NUCA Architecture on the difference of hop counts of all cache banks.
- Experiment 2
	- Identify areas of NUCA that are likely to consume more power and hence generate more heat.
- Experiment 3
	- Show the difference in hop counts of cache banks for WriteThrough and WriteBack policy.
